# Etymologiae 2.0

## Overview
This project aims to revolutionize the way goods and services data are shared and accessed by leveraging decentralized technologies. By utilizing magnet links and torrent files, we enable global, resilient access to goods and services information, reducing reliance on centralized servers and empowering both producers and consumers to contribute and maintain up-to-date datasets.

## Key Features
- **Decentralized Data Sharing**: Products and services data are shared via magnet links and torrents, making them accessible globally without the need for centralized infrastructure.
- **Global Catalog of Unique Identifiers**: Managed by the Crie foundation, Etymologiae associates unique identifiers (e.g., GTIN) with torrents containing official and community-enriched data.
- **Producer and Community Versions**:
  - **Producer Version**: Contains official data provided by the product manufacturer.
  - **Community Version**: Enriched with additional data by the Etymologiae community, such as OFFprice, extra images, and user-generated content.
- **GS1 Digital Links Integration**: [GS1 Digital Links](https://github.com/gs1/DigitalLinkDocs) ensure that key product data, including INCO 1169/2011 requirements (allergens, ingredients, nutritional values), is embedded within Digital Links, providing comprehensive product information.
- **AI-Ready Datasets**: Both producer and community data versions can be compiled into datasets for AI training, useful for market analysis, trend forecasting, and more.

## Context: Digital Product Passport and GS1 2D Barcodes
The European Union is advancing the concept of the Digital Product Passport as part of its Green Deal initiative, which mandates comprehensive product information to be available digitally. Etymologiae aligns with this initiative by providing a decentralized approach to managing and sharing product data, ensuring compliance with upcoming regulations.

Starting in 2027, GS1 standards will require 2D barcodes on products, which will include Digital Links. Etymologiae is designed to integrate seamlessly with these barcodes, allowing for real-time access to rich product information directly from the Digital Links embedded in the 2D barcodes.

## Reward System
To encourage active participation, contributors earn points for their efforts:
- **Data Sharing Points**: Users who download and share torrents earn points each month they remain active.
- **Contribution Points**: Additional points are awarded for improving product data or providing retail prices from physical or online stores.
- **Raffles and Prizes**: Accumulated points can be used to enter raffles, with prizes provided by participating producers, either for home delivery or in-store pickup.

## How It Works
1. **Product Data Publication**: Producers publish magnet links associated with their unique identifiers in the Etymologiae global catalog.
2. **Community Enrichment**: The Etymologiae community can create enriched versions of the product data, which are also linked in the catalog.
3. **Data Sharing**: Users download and share these torrents, contributing to the decentralized network.
4. **Earn Points**: Active sharing and data contributions earn users points that can be redeemed in raffles.
5. **AI Dataset Generation**: Both producer and community data are used to create robust datasets for AI applications.

## Benefits
- **Improved Accessibility**: Product data is always available globally, even if central servers go down.
- **Cost Reduction**: Torrent-based sharing reduces the need for expensive server infrastructure.
- **Enhanced Data Quality**: Community contributions lead to richer, more accurate product datasets.
- **Support for AI Research**: The system provides valuable datasets for AI training, benefiting multiple industries.
- **Compliance with EU Regulations**: Etymologiae is designed to align with the EU's Digital Product Passport initiative and future GS1 2D barcode requirements.

## How to Get Involved
- **Producers**: Publish your product data using our platform and gain access to a global audience.
- **Community Members**: Contribute by enriching product data, sharing torrents, and participating in our reward system.
- **Developers**: Help us build and maintain the platform, ensuring it remains open, secure, and efficient.

## Future Plans
- **Expansion of Reward System**: Continue developing incentives to increase community participation.
- **Integration with Other Platforms**: Explore partnerships to broaden the reach and utility of our datasets.
- **Advanced AI Applications**: Leverage the enriched datasets for cutting-edge AI research and development.
